#  Math → Coding

Connecting math to coding!  
Matrix operations and linear equations become powerful tools in code — major building blocks for **machine learning, neural networks, and data transformation**.  
They let us **solve big systems instantly** and **work with real-world datasets** efficiently.

**1. Computation of linear algebra with coding for quick solving a heavy maths.**

**2. Vector Spaces - A place where vector actually lives, some rules, and plotting with graph in a line(using quiver).**
